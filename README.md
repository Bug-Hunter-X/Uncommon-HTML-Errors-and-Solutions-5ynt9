# Uncommon HTML Errors and Solutions

This repository demonstrates some uncommon but potentially problematic errors in HTML code.  These errors often relate to semantic correctness, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility.

The `bug.html` file contains examples of these errors, while `bugSolution.html` offers corrected versions with explanations.

**Errors covered:**

* **Incorrect Tag Usage:** Using the wrong HTML tag for a given purpose (e.g., using `div` when `section` or `article` would be semantically more appropriate).
* **Improper Nesting:** Incorrectly nesting HTML elements, often affecting accessibility and rendering.
* **Missing Closing Tags:** Forgetting to close tags, which can lead to unexpected behavior across different browsers.

This repository aims to highlight these less-obvious errors and provide clear solutions for better HTML coding practices.
